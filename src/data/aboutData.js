    description1: "I’m Aniruth! A developer, musician, and lifelong learner currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at NYU.",
    description2: "My journey as a software engineer began at Apple, where I found the perfect balance of creativity and structure. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on automation and distributed systems, explored algorithms and design patterns, and contributed to open-source projects. Outside code, I play the guitar, drums, and piano, always chasing that same sense of flow I find in programming. I’m driven by the pursuit of clarity: in code, in design, and in thought.",
